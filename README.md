# IM646_Project

## Idea

Our   goal   for   this   project   is   to   create   a   data   visualisation   that   compares   the   population   of several   animals   to   the   population   of   humans   worldwide   by   the   measurement   of   their   weight and   count.   We   want   to   create   a   visualization   that   compares   the   occurrences   of   species   and their   relation   to   the   human   population.   Primarily   we   want   to   concentrate   on   animals   that   are used   for   agricultural   production,   because   the   excesses   of   food   production   seem   relevant   to us.
